# üïµÔ∏è Bug Bounty Recon Methodology

A structured and comprehensive recon methodology designed for bug bounty hunters to systematically gather information **during the recon phase**. This workflow focuses on **efficient data collection, organization, and analysis** to maximize effectiveness while keeping the process safe and non-intrusive.

## üåü Features

- **Structured Recon Workflow**: Step-by-step approach to subdomain enumeration, endpoint discovery, and footprinting.  
- **Tool Integration**: Compatible with popular recon tools for automation and efficiency.  
- **Passive First**: Prioritizes passive information gathering to reduce impact on targets.  
- **Organized Output**: Ensures data is collected and documented in a systematic way for easy analysis.

## üóÇ Methodology Overview

1. **Target Identification**  
   - Collect domains, IPs, and initial public information.  

2. **Passive Recon**  
   - Subdomain enumeration, OSINT gathering, scraping public sources.  
   - Examples: `crt.sh`, `SecurityTrails`, `whois`, `shodan`.

3. **Active Recon (Safe)**  
   - Non-intrusive scans and information gathering, like port scanning or optional zone transfers.  
   - Examples: `nmap`, `masscan` (configured safely).

4. **Endpoint Discovery**  
   - Identify directories, files, and hidden endpoints without exploiting vulnerabilities.  
   - Examples: `gau`, `feroxbuster`.

5. **Data Organization**  
   - Document findings, create inventories of hosts, endpoints, and services.  
   - Prepare data for later analysis or reporting.

## üõ† Recommended Tools & Example Commands

### Subdomain Enumeration
- **Amass**:  
  ```bash
  amass enum -d target.com -o subdomains.txt
Subfinder:
subfinder -d target.com -o subdomains.txt
Endpoint Discovery
GAU: 
gau target.com > urls.txt
feroxbuster:
feroxbuster -u https://target.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt



Perfect! Here's a fully **copy-paste-ready `README.md`** for your bug bounty recon methodology, focused entirely on the **recon phase**, with badges, table of contents, and example commands:

## üõ† Recommended Tools & Example Commands

### Subdomain Enumeration
- **Amass**:  
  ```bash
  amass enum -d target.com -o subdomains.txt
````

* **Subfinder**:

  ```bash
  subfinder -d target.com -o subdomains.txt
  ```

### Endpoint Discovery

* **Gau**:

  ```bash
  gau target.com > urls.txt
  ```
* **Feroxbuster**:

  ```bash
  feroxbuster -u https://target.com -w /path/to/wordlist.txt
  ```

### Passive Recon

* **crt.sh**: Search for certificates related to target domains.
* **whois**:

  ```bash
  whois target.com
  ```

### Safe Active Recon

* **Nmap** (non-intrusive):

  ```bash
  nmap -sS -Pn target.com
  ```
* **Masscan** (limited rate):

  ```bash
  masscan target.com -p0-65535 --rate=1000
  ```
